  The main purpose of the MERA Pill Dispenser is to simplify the way medication is taken. The goal is to allow each patient to have more freedom and rely less on their primary caretaker. Many individuals who are required to take multiple medications a day need a simple and efficient pill organizer. While many different pill organization systems exist on the market, most are costly and still require a great amount of maintenance from the patient or primary caretaker. With MERA Pill Dispenser we want to customize a pill organizing system that allows each patient to achieve sovereignty over their life and minimize their need for a medical assistant. 
  
  Users can use the MERA web interface to regulate their medication schedule and a Respberry Pi 2 will regulate containers that contains pills to dispense at specific times and dosage. This repository contains the code used by the Raspberry Pi 2 that controls the dispensing of pills.
